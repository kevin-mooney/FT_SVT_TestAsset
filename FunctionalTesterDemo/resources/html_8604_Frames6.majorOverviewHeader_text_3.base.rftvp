Doonesbury debuted that year, Ziggy came along one year later and Dear Abby jumped on board in 1980. The rest, as they say, is history. Over the years we&apos;ve attracted and acquired some of the world&apos;s most recognizable brands, with millions upon millions of loyal followers. Andrews McMeel Syndication formed in 2009 after the merger between Universal Press Syndicate and Uclick, which today operates as a single powerful media organization designed to help you reach massive audiences through integrated print, online and mobile products. The lineup we offer is diverse and of exceptional quality, continually serving the popular informational and entertainment needs of our time. Mission: To actively pursue and acquire the best creative talent, and to foster, distribute, and market this talent with the intent of informing and entertaining people around the world. </Val><Mask>false</Mask></MP><MP L=".MProp"><Prop>ignoreCase</Prop><Val Z="false"/><Mask>true</Mask></MP><MP L=".MProp"><Prop>whiteSpaceMode</Prop><Val L=".TextWhiteSpace"><Mode>0</Mode></Val><Mask>true</Mask></MP><MP L=".MProp"><Prop>description</Prop><Val>Visible Text</Val><Mask>true</Mask></MP><MP L=".MProp"><Prop>type</Prop><Val>text</Val><Mask>true</Mask></MP><MP L=".MProp"><Prop>name</Prop><Val>majorOverviewHeader_text_3</Val><Mask>true</Mask></MP></Data><FtVerificationPointMetaData L=".PropSet"><Prop L=".Prop"><Prop>FTVerificationPointType</Prop><Val>STATIC</Val></Prop></FtVerificationPointMetaData></TestDataText>
